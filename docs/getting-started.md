## ⚙️ Configuration

### Customizing PwGen

**GUI Settings:**
- Access via "Settings" menu
- Adjust theme, font size, and interface options

**Configuration File:**
Located at `~/.config/pwgen/config.toml`:

```toml
[ui]
theme = "auto"  # auto, light, dark
font_size = 14
window_size = [1200, 800]

[security]
auto_lock_minutes = 15
clipboard_clear_seconds = 30

[generator]
default_length = 16
default_symbols = true
```

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### Master Password
- Use a unique password not used elsewhere
- Consider using a passphrase for easier memorization
- Store a backup hint (not the password) in a secure location
- Never share your master password

### General Security
- Keep PwGen updated to the latest version
- Regularly create encrypted backups
- Use unique passwords for each account
- Enable two-factor authentication where available

### Vault Security
- Your vault file is encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- Key derivation uses Argon2 (memory-hard algorithm)
- Data is only decrypted in memory when needed
- Memory is securely cleared after use (Rust's zeroization)
- No data is sent over the network - fully local-first architecture

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Forgot Master Password:**
- Unfortunately, master passwords cannot be recovered
- You'll need to restore from a backup or start fresh
- This is by design for security

**Vault Won't Open:**
- Check that you're entering the correct master password
- Verify the vault file hasn't been corrupted
- Try restoring from a recent backup

**Performance Issues:**
- Large vaults (1000+ entries) may load slowly
- Consider organizing with tags for better navigation
- Regular cleanup of unused entries helps

**Import Issues:**
- Ensure source file is in the correct format
- Check for special characters that might cause parsing errors
- Try importing in smaller batches
