# Security Best Practices

Essential security guidelines for using PwGen-rust safely and effectively.

## Master Password Guidelines

### Creating a Strong Master Password

Your master password is the key to all your secrets. It must be:

1. **Unique** - Never used anywhere else
2. **Long** - Minimum 12 characters, recommend 16+
3. **Memorable** - You must remember it without writing it down
4. **Complex** - But not necessarily random

#### Recommended Approaches

**Passphrase Method (Recommended):**
```
Example: "Coffee@7AM!Makes-Me-Happy2024"
- Easy to remember
- Long and complex
- Personal meaning
- Includes symbols and numbers
```

**Story Method:**
```
Example: "MyDog$pot!Loves2Chase#Squirrels"
- Creates mental image
- Natural to type
- Includes variety
- Hard to guess
```

**Acronym Method:**
```
Example: "IgmF@MIT1998&GotMyPhD2004!"
(I graduated from MIT in 1998 and got my PhD in 2004!)
- Personal significance
- Mix of characters
- Easy to remember
- Unique to you
```

### What to Avoid

‚ùå **Common Patterns:**
- Password123!
- Qwerty!234
- Admin@2024
- P@ssw0rd

‚ùå **Personal Information:**
- Birthdays
- Names of family/pets
- Address information
- Phone numbers

‚ùå **Dictionary Words:**
- Even with substitutions (P@ssw0rd)
- Common phrases
- Keyboard patterns

## Operational Security

### Daily Usage

1. **Lock When Away**
   ```bash
   # Configure auto-lock (in minutes)
   pwgen-cli config set auto-lock-minutes 5
   ```
   - Always lock before stepping away
   - Use keyboard shortcut: `Ctrl+L`
   - Configure aggressive auto-lock for sensitive environments

2. **Clipboard Security**
   - Clipboard auto-clears after 30 seconds
   - Never paste passwords into untrusted applications
   - Be aware of clipboard managers that may store history

3. **Visual Security**
   - Position screen away from cameras/windows
   - Use privacy screens in public spaces
   - Be aware of shoulder surfers
   - Use password reveal sparingly

### System Security

1. **Keep Software Updated**
   ```bash
   # Check for updates regularly
   pwgen-cli --version
   
   # Update to latest version
   # Linux (Snap)
   sudo snap refresh pwgen-rust
   ```

2. **Secure Your Device**
   - Enable full-disk encryption
   - Use strong system password
   - Enable firewall
   - Keep OS updated
   - Use antivirus software

3. **Network Security**
   - PwGen-rust works offline (no network needed)
   - Be cautious of network monitoring
   - Use VPN on untrusted networks
   - Verify downloads from official sources

## Password Management

### Password Quality

1. **Use the Generator**
   ```bash
   # Generate strong passwords
   pwgen-cli generate --length 20 --symbols
   
   # For maximum security
   pwgen-cli generate --length 32 --all-chars
   ```

2. **Unique Passwords**
   - Never reuse passwords across sites
   - Use tags to organize similar accounts
   - Regular security audits to find duplicates

3. **Password Rotation**
   - Change passwords after breaches
   - Rotate high-value accounts quarterly
   - Update weak passwords immediately
   - Keep password history for recovery

### Account Organization

1. **Effective Tagging**
   ```
   Recommended tag structure:
   - Category: work, personal, family
   - Security: 2fa, no-2fa, sensitive
   - Type: email, banking, social, dev
   - Status: active, inactive, shared
   ```

2. **Naming Conventions**
   ```
   Good examples:
   - "GitHub - Personal"
   - "AWS - Work Account"
   - "Bank of America - Checking"
   
   Avoid:
   - "Login 1"
   - "Website"
   - "Password"
   ```

3. **Notes Field Usage**
   - Security questions (answers only)
   - Account numbers (partial)
   - Recovery information
   - 2FA backup codes

## Backup Strategy

### Regular Backups

1. **Backup Schedule**
   ```bash
   # Weekly backup (automate with cron)
   pwgen-cli backup create ~/backups/pwgen-$(date +%Y%m%d).backup
   ```

2. **Backup Storage**
   - Store on separate device
   - Encrypt backup location
   - Test restore process regularly
   - Keep multiple versions

3. **Backup Security**
   - Backups are encrypted with master password
   - Store backup password hint separately
   - Consider off-site storage
   - Protect backup media physically

### Recovery Planning

1. **Document Recovery Process**
   - Store instructions securely
   - Test recovery procedures
   - Keep software versions noted
   - Multiple recovery options

2. **Emergency Access**
   - Consider password splitting with trusted parties

## Advanced Security

### Two-Factor Authentication

1. **Enable 2FA Everywhere**
   - Prioritize financial accounts
   - Use app-based 2FA over SMS

   - Document 2FA setup in notes

2. **2FA Best Practices**
   ```
   Store in PwGen notes:
   - Backup codes (encrypted)
   - QR code text (for recovery)
   - Recovery phone/email
   - Setup date
   ```

### Secret Management

1. **API Keys**

   pwgen-cli list --older-than 365d
   ```

2. **Audit Checklist**
   - [ ] Review weak passwords
